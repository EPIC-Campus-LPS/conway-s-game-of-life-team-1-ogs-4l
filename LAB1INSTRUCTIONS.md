## Model-View-Controller
Describe the Model-View-Controller design framework in a few sentences.

The MVC framwork is a design pattern used for User Interface that makes the interface divided into the Model, View, and the Controller. The user views the input and uses the controller to send input to the Model, which in turn updates the view/output for the user. This framework is most popular for web applications since it clearly separates input, UI, and business end logic, as well as provides full control over HTML and URLs mapping.
