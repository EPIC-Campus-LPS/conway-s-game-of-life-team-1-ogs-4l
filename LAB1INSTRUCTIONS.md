## Research the Game of Life
Research Conway’s “Game of Life”.  Write a paragraph summarizing his research.  Talk about some of the interesting different types of “organism patterns” and why this is an interesting topic to learn about.  


John Conway chose his specific rules for the game of life in order to not let the cells die too fast or overpopulate. His rules make it impossible to know whether a cell with multiple, die, or stabilize. Some objects that emerge are still life objects, no live cells die and no new cells are born. There are also some oscillators, objects that change from step to step but repeat. Not all patterns will stabilze eventually. This is so interesting to learn about because in nature we observe similar phenomena. We can simulate real life, even though we aren't sure of all the rules yet.

## Model-View-Controller
Describe the Model-View-Controller design framework in a few sentences.

The MVC framwork is a design pattern used for User Interface that makes the interface divided into the Model, View, and the Controller. The user views the input and uses the controller to send input to the Model, which in turn updates the view/output for the user. This framework is most popular for web applications since it clearly separates input, UI, and business end logic, as well as provides full control over HTML and URLs mapping.
